## Prerequisites: 
    1. SSH connection to your Raspberry Pi (Using the Secure Shell App)
    2. Install Git on your Raspberry Pi (Should already be installed)

## How to execute code:
    1. `git clone https://github.com/stcline/Raspberry-Pi-Servo-Control`
    2. `cd Raspberry-Pi-Servo-Control`
    3. `sudo python main.py`
    
If everything is connected properly, your servo should be moving through several positions.  Feel free to mess around with the code a little if you like.
